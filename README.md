# Spermatid-Image-Analysis
The Spermatid Identification Model is a nueral network that can be used to predict the step of spermatids that have been stained with DAPI to mark nucleic material.  The model specifically identifies spermatids in stages 8-15+ and does so with an accuracy of <u>TODO</u>.   Trained on __ images, the The model is a standard convolutional nueral network with 3 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers and takes in 800x800 color images in jpg format.  However the model can take larger images it will simply resize to 800x800.  In order to download and use the model follow the instructions outlined in this overview.  

## How to use
In order to use the model, download this repository and open a terminal or virtual environment with access to the standard python library.  For users umfamiliar with this process, it is recommended to download anaconda which includes several tools but specifically the standard python library and an easy to use terminal.  In order to do this follow this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and download the correct version for your operating system.

From there open the Anaconda Prompt from the windows search bar.  This terminal will be the main interface for the model and
