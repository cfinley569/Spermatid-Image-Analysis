# Spermatid-Image-Analysis
The Spermatid Identification Model is a nueral network that can be used to predict the step of spermatids that have been stained with DAPI to mark nucleic material.  The model is a standard convolutional nueral network with 3 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers and takes in 800x800 color image in jpg format.  In order to download and use the model follow the instructions outlined in this overview.
