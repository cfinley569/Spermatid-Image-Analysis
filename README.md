# Spermatid-Image-Analysis
The Spermatid Identification Model is a nueral network that can be used to predict the step of spermatids that have been stained with DAPI to mark nucleic material.  The model is a standard convolutional nueral network with 3 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers and takes in 800x800 color images in jpg format.  However the model can take larger images it will simply resize to 800x800.  In order to download and use the model follow the instructions outlined in this overview.  

## How to use
In order to use the model, download this repository and open a terminal or virtual environment with access to the standard python library.  For users umfamiliar with this process, type Windows PowerShell into the windows search bar and select.  In the terminal that opens, type the command 
'''python 
pip install python3
''' 
From there you can either run the command 'python' to begin a python prompt or you can preface each of the following arguments with 'python' for the same effect.
