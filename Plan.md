#PLAN

1. Image preprocessing
    - Evaluate data from JPEG
        -read up on JPEG file format
    - ensure image is correct size (resize?)
    - convert to array of pixel values

2. Build Neural Network
    - TensorFlow
        - experiment with multiple convolutional/pooling layers
        - end with 13 results
    - determine activation function type, loss function, and optimization method

3. Train
    - Need about ~100 of each type
    - Research training-with-low-data methods

4. Test
    - test on 10 of each image
    - determine needed success accuracy 

5. Build API (GUI?)
    - Flesh out Github repository
    - Step by Step instructions
    - Expand allowed file formats
